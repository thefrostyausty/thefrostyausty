### Hi there 👋

## You’ve landed on this profile page for a reason…and that is to see what Austin J. Robinson is all about. Well, let this blurb lay it out for you. I decided to move towards learning about web development and software engineering because I wanted to make a change in my career path. I wanted to take hold of my future and show that with my adaptability, I would be able to become a skilled software developer and be proud of this career choice.NOW, though I have to do the hard part…actually getting the job. This is where you, hopefully you are a recruiter for a job that you’d love to give me, play a part! One of my many favorite quotes is: 'Nothing will work, unless you do' spoken by Maya Angelou, and that's exactly what I plan to do if you consider me. So this Michigan based developer only has one last thing to say: ‘Hire me please and you won’t regret it, even if I make mistakes..maybe.” :)
